Steps to create class an immutable:


`-data members in the class must be declared as final(so that we can't change
the value of it after object creation)
`

`-the class must be declared as final(so that child classes can't be created)
`

`-parameterized constructor
`

`-getter method for allthe variables of it
`

`-No setters (to not have the option to change the value of
the instance variable)
`
